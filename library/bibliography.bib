abstract = {From the Publisher: Now that the Internet has blossomed into the "Information Superhighway" with its traffic and drivers becoming increasingly diverse, security has emerged as a primary concern. This innovative, new book offers you a global, integrated approach to providing Internet Security at the network layer. You get a detailed presentation of the revolutionary IPsec technology used today to create Virtual Private Networks and, in the near future, to protect the infrastructure of the Internet itself. The book addresses IPsec's major aspects and components to help you evaluate and compare features of different implementations. It gives you a detailed understanding of this cutting-edge technology from the inside, which enables you to more effectively troubleshoot problems with specific products. Based on standards documents, discussion list archives, and practitioners' lore, this one-of-a-kind resource collects all the current knowledge of IPsec and describes it in a literate, clear manner.}

abstract={This paper proposes two efficient architectures for hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The composite field arithmetic for implementing SubBytes (S-box) and InvSubBytes (Inverse S-box) transformations investigated by several authors is used as the basis for deriving the proposed architectures. The first architecture for encryption is based on optimized S-box followed by bit-wise implementation of MixColumns and AddRoundKey and optimized Inverse S-box followed by bit-wise implementation of InvMixColumns and AddMixRoundKey for decryption. The proposed S-box and Inverse S-box used in this architecture are designed as a cascade of three blocks. In the second proposed architecture, the block III of the proposed S-box is combined with the MixColumns and AddRoundKey transformations forming an integrated unit for encryption. An integrated unit for decryption combining the block III of the proposed InvSubBytes with InvMixColumns and AddMixRoundKey is formed on similar lines. The delays of the proposed architectures for VLSI implementation are found to be the shortest compared to the state-of-the-art implementations of AES operating in non-feedback mode. Iterative and fully unrolled sub-pipelined designs including key schedule are implemented using FPGA and ASIC. The proposed designs are efficient in terms of Kgates/Giga-bits per second ratio compared with few recent state-of-the-art ASIC (0.18-$\mu$m CMOS standard cell) based designs and throughput per area (TPA) for FPGA implementations.},
